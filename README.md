## How To Host

###### To run this application locally, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) installed on your computer).

### Hosted

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FJamsRepos%2Fjdf.gg)

1. Click the button above to Deploy your own instance on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), I recommend signing in with GitHub.

2. Once signed in, the button should automatically clone the repository and start deploying your own instance.

3. You should receive your URL to your hosted environment, the URL should look like `https://<REPO NAME>.vercel.app/`.

4. (optional) Set up your own custom domain via DNS.

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository after following the **Hosted** instructions.

2. Go to the project directory, whether that be from using GitHub Desktop or cloning through CLI.

3. Install dependencies to ensure the project starts properly.

    ```bash
      yarn
    ```

4. Start your local development environment, the URL will be posted in your console.

    ```bash
      yarn dev
    ```

#### Editing Content

- To change the content, edit `src/utils/portfolio.ts`.

- To change the **resume**, change `/public/resume.pdf` with your resume, edit the name of this in `/src/utils/config.ts`.

- To change the **About Section**, edit `src/containers/About.tsx`.

- To change the theme, edit `src/styles/globals.css`.

## Why I Forked

As a developer turned cyber security engineer, I found myself short on time to maintain my own portfolio website while working on new projects and my full-time job. My personal portfolio site had also become neglected over time, and I realized that it was better to support and provide more eyes on developers who can allocate more time into making perfect free and open-source repositories.

That's why I decided to fork this portfolio website from [Vatsal Signh](https://vatsalsinghkv.vercel.app/) and customize it to fit my needs. I am grateful to the original author for making this portfolio website available as open source and for the inspiration it provided for my own portfolio.
